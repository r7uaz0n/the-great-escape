    <h1 id="escape">The Dungeon</h1>

    <h2 id="description">ou awaken with a huge hangover in a damp, cold, wet and slimy what seems to be an 8'x 8' stone dungeon prison cell with a steel door. A flickering torch outside dimly penetrates around the corner with an eerie, ominious lumination from across the dungeon hallway.  You panic with anxiety, because you know you need to get the bleep outta here.  Miraculously, after doing a quadruple take, you see a shiny key on the floor near a gap under the cell door.</h2>


    <button id="optionOne">Grab the key</button>
    <button id="optionTwo">Dude, open the door already!</button>
