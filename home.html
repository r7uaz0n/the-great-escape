    <h1 id="escape">The Dungeon</h1>

    <h2 id="description">You in a drunken stupor.  It is damp. You feel cold, wet and slimy. You scan the area and see you're trapped in a stone dungeon prison cell. There is a wrought iron door with a mithril steel keyhole. A flickering torch outside dimly penetrates around the corner with an eerie, ominious lumination from across the dungeon hallway.  You panic with anxiety, because you know you need to get the bleep outta here.  Miraculously, after doing a quadruple take, you see a shiny key on the floor.  The key shimmers with power!</h2>
